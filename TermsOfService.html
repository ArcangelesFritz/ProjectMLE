<p>HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE YOU WILL NEED TO USE THE SITE SERVICES FOR YOUR BUSINESS</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">UPWORK ACCOUNTS</h2>
<h2 class="section-heading">3.1 ACCOUNT ELIGIBILITY</h2>
<p>To use the Site and certain Site Services, you must register for an Account.  Upwork offers the Site and Site Services for your business purposes only, and not for personal, household, or consumer use.  To use the Site and Site Services, you must have, and hereby represent that you have, an independent business (whether it be as a self-employed individual/sole proprietor or as a corporation or other entity) and further represent that you intend to use the Site and Site Services for your business purposes only, unless you use the Site and Site Services solely as an employee and Agency Member of a registered Agency Account.  You understand that you must comply with any licensing or registration requirements with respect to your business, and you represent that you comply with all such requirements.  To register for an Account, you must be, and hereby represent that you are, a legal entity or an individual 18 years or older who can form legally binding contracts.  By registering for an Account, by using the Site or Site Services after the Effective Date if you had an account on the Effective Date, or by clicking to accept the Terms of Service when prompted on the Site, you agree to: (a) abide by this Agreement and the other Terms of Service; (b) be financially responsible for your use of the Site and the purchase or delivery of Freelancer Services; and (c) perform your obligations as specified by any Service Contract that you enter into, unless such obligations are prohibited by applicable law or the Terms of Service.  Upwork reserves the right, in our sole discretion, to refuse, suspend, or revoke your access to the Site and Site Services upon discovery that any information you provided on any form or posted on the Site is not true, accurate, or complete, or such information or other conduct otherwise violates the Terms of Service, or for any other reason or no reason in Upwork’s sole discretion.</p>
<p>You represent that you are not: (x) a citizen or resident of a geographic area in which access to or use of the Site or Site Services is prohibited by applicable law, decree, regulation, treaty, or administrative act; (y) a citizen or resident of, or located in, a geographic area that is subject to U.S. or other sovereign country sanctions or embargoes; or (z) an individual, or an individual employed by or associated with an entity, identified on the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Denied Persons or Entity List, the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Specially Designated Nationals or Blocked Persons Lists, or the U.S. Department of State’s Debarred Parties List or otherwise ineligible to receive items subject to U.S. export control laws and regulations or other economic sanction rules of any sovereign nation. You agree that if your country of residence or other circumstances change such that the above representations are no longer accurate, that you will immediately cease using the Site and Site Services. </p>
<h2 class="section-heading">3.2 ACCOUNT REGISTRATION; PROFILE</h2>
<p>By registering for an account, you must complete a User profile (“Profile”), which you consent to be shown to other Users and, unless you change your privacy settings, the public.  If you are a Freelancer, unless you use the Site solely as an employee and Agency Member of a registered Agency Account, you represent and warrant that you use your Profile to market your business to others for the purpose of entering into independent contractor relationships with other Users.  You agree to provide true, accurate, and complete information on your Profile and all registration and other forms you access on the Site or provide to us and to update your information to maintain its truthfulness, accuracy, and completeness.  You agree not to provide and to correct any information about your location, your business, your skills, or the services your business provides that is or becomes false or misleading.  You agree not to register for more than one Client Account and one Freelancer Account without express written permission from us (except that you may register as an Agency Member of other Accounts as provided below).  You agree not to ask or allow another person to create an Account on your behalf, for your use, or for your benefit.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">3.3 IDENTITY VERIFICATION  </h2>
<p>When you register for an Account and from time to time thereafter, your Account will be subject to verification, including, but not limited to, validation against third-party databases or the verification of one or more official government or legal documents that confirm your identity and your ability to represent your business on Upwork, if it is a separate legal entity.  You authorize Upwork, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries necessary to validate your identity and confirm your ownership of your email address or financial accounts, subject to applicable law.  When requested, you must provide us with information about you and your business.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">3.4 AGENCY ACCOUNTS</h2>
<p>You may create an account through which other authorized Freelancers (each, an “Agency Member”) may act on your behalf in the roles you assign for your account (an “Agency Account”).  A Freelancer creates an Agency Account on behalf of a business (the “Agency”), which may be the Freelancer as a sole proprietor or a partnership, corporation, or other legal entity the User controls.  The Freelancer that registered the Agency Account may also grant certain account administration privileges for the Agency Account to one or more Agency Members (each, an “Agency Account Administrator”).  Except as otherwise required by applicable law, only the User who registered the Agency Account and the Agency Account Administrators can add or remove Agency Members to or from the Agency Account.</p>
<p>Each Agency Member must have an Account and a Profile.  You understand and agree that the Agency may determine the Profile visibility and hourly rate of any of its Agency Members, and you authorize the Agency to do so by becoming an Agency Member.  Each Agency Member must be a User and must be a real person or legally recognized entity.  Each Agency Member’s Account Profile must contain the Agency Member’s real name, and Agency Members must comply with all Terms of Service.  Agency Members’ identities will be subject to verification.  If any of your Agency Members violate the Terms of Service, it may affect your ability to use the Site.   Upon closure of an Agency Account, Upwork may close any or all related Accounts.</p>
<p>You agree to grant access to the Agency Account, including with respect to any Agency Members, only to Users authorized to act on your behalf and only in accordance with the Terms of Service.  Additionally, you agree to be fully responsible and liable for any action of any Agency Member and any other User who uses the Agency Account, including Agency Account Administrators.  You represent that your Agency Members have the authority to accept the Terms of Service on your behalf and to create a legally binding obligation on your behalf.  You understand and agree that an Agency Member may accept and enter into Service Contracts on behalf of the Agency, and that the Agency is responsible and liable for all Service Contracts accepted by anyone acting as an Agency Member.  </p>
<p>Each Agency Member is either an employee or an independent contractor of the Agency, as determined by the Agency.  Without limiting the Agency’s obligations described in Section 8.2 (Responsibility for Employees and Subcontractors, Including Agency Members), the Agency acknowledges and agrees that it assumes all liability for the classification of its Agency Members as employees or independent contractors.  The Agency further acknowledges and agrees that the Agency is responsible for paying its Agency Members.  Agency Members acknowledge and agree that their Agency is solely responsible for paying them for work on behalf of the Agency and that such payments will not be made through the Site.</p>
<p>Your Agency Account (including feedback) and username are transferable only upon Upwork’s approval, at Upwork’s sole discretion.</p>
<p>You understand and agree that Agency Members’ Profiles may display work history that includes work done under the Agency, including after the Agency Member is no longer an Agency Member.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">3.5 USERNAMES AND PASSWORDS</h2>
<p>When you register for an Account, you will be asked to choose a username and password for the Account.  Each User and any Agency Account Administrator will also be asked to choose the initial username and password for any Agency Account that is added to the Account (and can change the password for the Agency Account at any time).</p>
<p>You are entirely responsible for safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of your Account or Agency Account username and password.  You authorize Upwork to assume that any person using the Site with your username and password, either is you or is authorized to act for you.  You agree to notify us immediately if you suspect or become aware of any unauthorized use of your Account or Agency Account or any unauthorized access to your password or the password of any User of your Account (or any related Agency Account).  You further agree not to use any username, or password of another User of the Site that you are not authorized to use, and not to allow others who are not authorized to do so to use your Account or Agency Account at any time.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">3.6 MARKETPLACE FEEDBACK</h2>

<p>You acknowledge and agree that feedback benefits the marketplace, all Users, and the efficiency of the Site and you specifically request that Upwork post composite or compiled feedback about Users, including yourself, on User Profiles and elsewhere on the Site. You acknowledge and agree that feedback results for you, including your Job Success Score (“JSS”), if any, will consist of comments, ratings, indicators of User satisfaction, and other feedback left by other Users.  You further acknowledge and agree that Upwork will make feedback results available to other marketplace Users, including composite or compiled feedback.  Upwork provides this feedback system as a means through which Users can share their opinions publicly and Upwork does not monitor or censor these opinions.  You acknowledge and agree that posted composite or compiled feedback and any JSS relate only to the business advertised in the Freelancer Profile and not to any individual person.  You agree not to use the JSS to make any employment, credit, credit valuation, underwriting, or other similar decision about any other User. </p> 
<p>Upwork does not investigate any remarks posted by Users for accuracy or reliability but may do so if a User requests that Upwork do so.  You may be held legally responsible for damages suffered by other Users or third parties as a result of your remarks if such remarks are legally actionable or defamatory.  Upwork is not legally responsible for any feedback or comments posted or made available on the Site by any Users or third parties, even if that information is defamatory or otherwise legally actionable.  In order to protect the integrity of the feedback system and protect Users from abuse, Upwork reserves the right (but is under no obligation) to remove posted feedback or information that, in Upwork’s sole judgment, violates the Terms of Service or negatively affects our marketplace.  You acknowledge and agree that you will notify Upwork of any error or inaccurate statement in your feedback results, including the JSS, and that if you do not do so, Upwork may rely on the accuracy of such information.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">4. PURPOSE OF THE SITE AND SITE SERVICES</h2>
<p>The Site is a marketplace where Clients and Freelancers can identify each other and advertise, buy, and sell Freelancer Services online.  Subject to the Terms of Service, Upwork provides the Site Services to Users, including hosting and maintaining the Site, enabling the formation of Service Contracts, and coordinating disputes related to those Service Contracts.  If Users agree on terms for Freelancer Services, a Service Contract is formed directly between such Users, subject to the provisions set forth in Section 5 (Contractual Relationship Between Client and Freelancer), unless you are enrolled in Upwork Payroll.  When a User enters a Service Contract, the User uses the Site to engage, communicate, invoice and pay online.
<h2 class="section-heading">4.1 ESCROW ACCOUNTS</h2>
<p>Upwork Escrow provides escrow services to Users to deliver, hold, or receive payment for an Engagement, and to pay service, membership and payment processing and administration fees to Upwork (“Escrow Services”).  Upwork Escrow is a Delaware corporation and a licensed Internet escrow agent and holds California Department of Business Oversight License No. 963 5086.  The Escrow Services are intended for business use, so you agree to use the Escrow Services only for business purposes and not for consumer, personal, family, or household purposes.</p>
<p>Depending on your needs and the applicable Escrow Instructions, Upwork Escrow will establish and maintain one of three different types of Escrow Accounts, subject to the applicable Escrow Agreement:</p>
<p>(a)  Client Escrow Account.  After entering into a Service Contract, the first time a Client makes a payment for an Engagement, Upwork Escrow will establish and maintain a “Client Escrow Account” to hold funds for the Client to use to make payments for Engagements, to receive refunds in connection with Engagements, and to make payments to Upwork for payment processing and administration fees.</p>
<p>(b)  Freelancer Escrow Account.  After entering into a Service Contract, the first time a Freelancer uses the Site to receive payment for an Engagement, Upwork Escrow will establish and maintain a “Freelancer Escrow Account” for the Freelancer to receive payments for Engagements, withdraw payments, make monthly membership payments and service fees to Upwork, and issue refunds to Clients.</p>
<p>(c)  Fixed-Price Escrow Account.  When you enter into a Fixed-Price Contract, Upwork Escrow will establish and maintain a “Fixed-Price Escrow Account” to receive, hold, and release payments pursuant to the Fixed-Price Escrow Instructions for the Engagement that is the subject of that Service Contract.</p>
<p>You hereby authorize and instruct Upwork Escrow to act as escrow agent in connection with the Escrow Accounts and the payment, holding, and receipt of funds for each Engagement and other specified purposes (the “Escrow”) in accordance with the Terms of Service and the applicable Escrow Instructions.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">5. CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLIENT AND FREELANCER</h2>
<h2 class="section-heading">5.1 SERVICE CONTRACTS</h2>
<p>Unless you use the services described in the Upwork Payroll Agreement (such services, “Upwork Payroll”), you acknowledge and agree that a Service Contract is comprised of the following agreements (as applicable): (a) The Fixed-Price Escrow Instructions; (b) the Hourly, Bonus and Expense Payment Agreement with Escrow Instructions; (c) the Engagement terms awarded and accepted on the Site to the extent that the terms do not, and do not purport to, expand Upwork’s obligations or restrict Upwork’s rights under the Terms of Service; (d) the terms in Section 8 (Service Contract Terms), unless other terms are agreed to by the parties, to the extent that the provisions do not, and do not purport to, expand Upwork’s obligations or restrict Upwork’s rights under the Terms of Service; and (e) any other contractual provisions accepted by both the Client and the Freelancer, to the extent that the provisions do not, and do not purport to, expand Upwork’s obligations or restrict Upwork’s rights under the Terms of Service.  You acknowledge and agree that Upwork is not a party to any Service Contracts, and that the formation of a Service Contract between Users will not, under any circumstance, create an employment or other service relationship between Upwork and any Freelancer.</p>
<h2 class="section-heading">5.2 PAYMENT AGREEMENTS AND ESCROW INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
<p>Fixed-Price Engagements.  If Users choose fixed-price compensation, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Upwork Escrow will follow, the Fixed-Price Escrow Instructions.</p>
<p>Hourly Engagements, Bonus Payments, or Expense Payments.  If Users choose hourly compensation, and/or if the Client makes bonus or expense payments, then the Users agree that they will be bound by, and Upwork Escrow will follow, the Hourly, Bonus and Expense Payment Agreement with Escrow Instructions.</p>
